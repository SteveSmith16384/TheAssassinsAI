AI SQUAD

This is a simple exercise in AI: 2 AI-controlled squads battle against each other.  The assassins (green) are trying to find and kill the single unit in white, and the defenders (red) are trying to protect him by killing all the assassins.  (If you've ever heard of Laser Squad, it's basically 2 AI's playing in realtime).

This is not a game.  You just watch it play out.  Each "game" is different.
